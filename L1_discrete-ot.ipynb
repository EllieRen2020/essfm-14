    "### Optimal Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the problem of assigning a possibly infinite number of workers\n",
    "and firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each worker should work for one firm, and each firm should hire one worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workers and firms have heterogenous characteristics; let $x\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and $y\\in\\mathcal{Y}$ be the characteristics of workers and firms respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workers and firms are in equal mass, which is normalized to one. The distribution of worker's types is $P$, and the distribution of the firm's types is $Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are probability measures on $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that if a worker $x$ matches with a firm $y$, the total output generated is $\\Phi_{xy}$. The questions are then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimality:** what is the optimal assignment in the sense that it maximizes the overal output generated?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Equilibrium:** what are the equilibrium assignment and the equilibrium wages?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency:** do these two notions coincide?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same tools have been used by Gary Becker to study the heterosexual marriage market, where $x$ is the man's characteristics, and $y$ is the woman's characteristics, and \"wages\" are replaced by \"transfers\".\n"

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we shall take a look at marriage data (while a worker-firm example will be seen in next block). Dupuy and Galichon (JPE, 2014) study a marriage dataset where, in addition to usual socio-demographic variables (such as education and age), measures of personality traits are reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The literature on quantitative psychology argues that one can capture relatively well an individual's personality along five dimensions, the \"big 5\" - consciousness, extraversion, agreableness, emotional stability, autonomy - assessed though a standardized questionaire.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In addition to this, we observed a (self-assessed) measure of health, risk-aversion, education, height and body mass index = weight in kg/ (height in m)$^2$. In total, the available characteristics $x_{i}$ of man $i$ and $y_{j}$ of woman $j$ are both $10$-dimensional vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is assumed that the surplus of interaction is given by $\\Phi\\left(x_{i},y_{j}\\right)  =x_{i}^{\\intercal}Ay_{j}$, where $A$ is a *given* $10 \\times 10$ matrix. (later in this course, we'll see how to estimate $A$ based on matched marital data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we solve a central planner's problem (a stylized version of the problem OKCupids would solve): given a population of men and a population of women, how do we mutually assign these in order to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. maximize matching surplus \n",
